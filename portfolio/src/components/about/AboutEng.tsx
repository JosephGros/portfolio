        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Joseph Gros, a passionate 26-year-old originally from
          America, now embracing life in Sweden since the age of four.
          Currently, I reside in Salem with my wonderful wife Anna and our
          newborn son, Noah. This November, we're eagerly looking forward to
          moving to Gnesta, where we hope to continue building our future
          together. My educational journey has been deeply focused on technology
          and development. I am currently enrolled in the Fullstack Web
          Developer program at CHAS Academy, with an expected completion date in
          June 2025. My academic foundation was laid at RÃ¶nninge Gymnasium,
          specializing in Technology with a focus on Information and Media. From
          a young age, I've been drawn to the intricacies of programming and
          problem-solving, finding joy in creating structured solutions. This
          passion naturally led me to discover web development, where I've found
          my calling. It's not just a career path for me; it's a fulfilling
          daily pursuit that blends seamlessly with my personal interests.
          Beyond coding, I cherish spending quality time with my family and
          friends, indulging in my hobbies such as playing video games and
          enjoying the strategic gameplay of Magic: The Gathering. These
          activities not only provide relaxation but also stimulate my mind,
          enhancing my problem-solving skills in unexpected ways. In summary, my
          life revolves around the harmonious balance of family, education, and
          personal interests. Each day presents new opportunities to grow as a
          developer and as a person, driven by my love for structured
          problem-solving and my unwavering commitment to creating meaningful
          experiences through web development.
